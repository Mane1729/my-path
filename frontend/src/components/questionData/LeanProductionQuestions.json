      "question": "Imagine you're working at a local coffee shop. You notice that during peak hours, the queue often backs up and customers are waiting for a long time. You've identified that the time-consuming part is the process of making the coffee itself, which includes: taking the order, collecting payment, passing the order to the barista, preparing the coffee, serving the coffee to the customer, and then cleaning up for the next order. How would you improve this process and reduce the waiting time for customers?",
